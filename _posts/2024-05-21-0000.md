As Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to permeate our everyday life, concerns about user privacy have surged. One groundbreaking technique in play today to address these concerns is the use of Differentially Private Synthetic Data in Machine Learning (ML). This approach provides a robust mathematical guarantee that users' personal information will not peek through the model's predictions.

In the ML landscape, differentially private synthetic data is created by algorithmically transforming the original data into artificial data, maintaining the same essential characteristics but completely distorting user-specific details. This synthetic data finds use in various aspects such as feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and more profoundly, in debugging an ML algorithm. Moreover, it can be retained for extended periods to further support continuous monitoring and alerting.

One of the key applications of this approach is in content classification, ensuring safe and user-amenable content. Using synthetic data, ML models can evaluate content quality and appropriateness without compromising user data. This technique is particularly beneficial for organizations seeking to externalize their sensitive data to external researchers and academics without infringing privacy protocols.

The technique underpinning the creation of this synthetic data is the Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD). The private synthetic data is created by fine-tuning publicly available Large Language Models (LLMs). Trained on vast datasets, these LLMs are fine-tuned using DP-SGD on sensitive datasets, ensuring that the data generated does not compromise the privacy of users who contributed to the sensitive dataset.

Parameter-Efficient Private Fine-tuning is a revolutionary technique in the private synthetic data generation field. Instead of modifying all the weights in the LLM model, only a smaller number of weights are trained, proving to be efficient and delivering high-quality results. While reducing the number of trainable parameters might risk quality, it has been observed that there exists an optimal number of trainable parameters that maximize data quality while preserving privacy.

This potent privacy-preserving technique is used in Google's Mobile Foundation Model to generate safe content for users. The methodology generates private synthetic data out of potentially unsafe content, which is effectively used for training an AI-based safety classification model, designed to detect any inappropriate content.

This innovative approach of preserving user privacy has already started paving the pathway towards a safer, private, and more reliable AI and ML applications.
